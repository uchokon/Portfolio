                    <h2>Hello!</h2>
                    My name is Ucheoma Okonkwo. I am currently a junior persuing a double major in Studio Art and Information Science at the University of Maryland, College Park.
                    Since recieving my first Wacom tablet at the age of twelve, I have had a strong interest in graphic and web design. I hope to enter either field as a full-time proffessional after I graduate.

                <h2>Welcome to my portfolio, made by me.</h2>

                <ul>
                    <li>Freelance work through online commissions</li>
                    <li>School assignments and projects</li>
                    <li>Udemy exercises focused in graphic design</li>
                    <li>Personal projects</li>
                </ul>
                Within each category hosts peices of various mediums (Adobe Illustrator, charcoal, acrylic on canvas, etc). 
                I hope that this portfolio may successfully showcase my potential as a future designer.
